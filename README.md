# 🫖 The TEA Stack 

Welcome to the most pragmatic stack out there. This project combines TailwindCSS, Eleventy, and Alpine.js to make static site generation easy and minimal!

It also uses ESBuild and Tailwind's CLI under the hood to bundle and compile your JS and CSS, respectively.

## Getting Started

Just run the usual commands and peep the `package.json` file to see the available scripts and packages.

For the lazy:

- 💿 `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- 👨🏻‍💻 `npm run dev` to boot up that dev server and start building
- 🛠 `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site!
